# Deep-Q-Learning-Agent-for-CartPole
This project demonstrates how to train a reinforcement learning agent using **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)** to solve the classic control problem **CartPole-v1** from OpenAI Gym. The agent learns to balance a pole on a moving cart using trial and error.

Train an agent that learns the optimal policy to keep the pole balanced for as long as possible by interacting with the environment and improving over time using neural network approximations of Q-values.
